I routed all the necesary links to the end points we 
need but we might need to redesign this as its to many open end points 

I have not created any views as of yet but will be working on that next
and also routing to that soon.

the end points I created can only be accesed thru the post method
Tools like post man should be able to help see them. 

No Kevia you cant use the browser for those end points.
